A emacs extension that copies the contents of the current buffer to the MacOS clipboard.
 
To install:

1) Add a line to your .emacs file to include the pbcopy extension to your Emacs configuration:

 (load "/path/to/pbcopy/location/pbcopy")

 Note that you don't need to include the ".el" extension in the path above.

2) Launch emacs.

3) Use M-x pbcopy to invoke the extension and copy buffer to MacOS clipboard.

4) Ctrl-V wherever you want!
